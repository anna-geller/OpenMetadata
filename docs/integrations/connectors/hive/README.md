# Hive

Configure and schedule Hive **metadata** and **profiler** workflows from the OpenMetadata UI.

* [Requirements](./#requirements)
* [Metadata Ingestion](./#metadata-ingestion)
* [Data Profiler and Quality Tests](./#data-profiler-and-quality-tests)
* [DBT Integration](./#dbt-integration)

If you don't want to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion container to configure the workflows via the UI, then you can check the following docs to connect using Airflow SDK or with the CLI.

## Requirements

#### **OpenMetadata (version 0.10 or later)**

To deploy OpenMetadata, follow the procedure [Try OpenMetadata in Docker](../../../../overview/run-openmetadata.md) or follow the [OpenMetadata & Prefect](../../../../overview/run-openmetadata-with-prefect.md) guide.

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata [Ingestion Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/openmetadata/ingestion), which comes shipped with custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

### 1. Visit the _Services_ Page

The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under Settings you will find a **Services** link an external source system to OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.

To visit the _Services_ page, select _Services_ from the _Settings_ menu.

![Navigate to Settings >> Services](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (2).png>)

### 2. Create a New Service

Click on the _Add New Service_ button to start the Service creation.

![Add a New Service from the Database Services Page](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (61).png>)

### 3. Select the Service Type

Select Hive as the service type and click _Next_.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (51).png>)

### 4. Name and Describe your Service <a href="#4.-name-and-describe-your-service" id="4.-name-and-describe-your-service"></a>

Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.

#### Service Name <a href="#service-name" id="service-name"></a>

OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their _Service Name_. Provide a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including the other Hive services that you might be ingesting metadata from.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

### 5. Configure the Service Connection <a href="#5.-configure-the-service-connection" id="5.-configure-the-service-connection"></a>

In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that you've configured the connector to read from your Hive service as desired.

![Configure the Service connection](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png>)

<details>

<summary>Connection Arguments</summary>

**Username**

Enter the username of your Hive user in the _Username_ field. The specified user should be authorized to read all databases you want to include in the metadata ingestion workflow.

**Password**

Enter the password for your Hive user in the _Password_ field.

**Host and Port**

Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Hive deployment in the _Host and Port_ field.

**Database (optional)**

If you want to limit metadata ingestion to a single database, enter the name of this database in the Database field. If no value is entered for this field, the connector will ingest metadata from all databases that the specified user is authorized to read.

**URL Authentication Options (Optional)**

Authentication options to pass to Hive connector. These options are based on SQLAlchemy.

**Connection Options (Optional)**

Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to Hive during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**

Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to Hive during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

To specify the LDAP Authentication, add the Key-Value pair: `auth` & `LDAP`.

</details>

### 6. Configure the Metadata Ingestion <a href="#6.-configure-the-metadata-ingestion" id="6.-configure-the-metadata-ingestion"></a>

Once the service is created, we can add a **Metadata Ingestion Workflow**, either directly from the _Add Ingestion_ button in the figure above, or from the Service page:

![Add a Metadata Ingestion Workflow from the Service Page](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12) (1) (1).png>)

<details>

<summary>Metadata Ingestion Options</summary>

**Include (Table Filter Pattern)**

Use to table filter patterns to control whether or not to include tables as part of metadata ingestion and data profiling.

Explicitly include tables by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the _Include_ field. OpenMetadata will include all tables with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other tables will be excluded. See the figure above for an example.

**Exclude (Table Filter Pattern)**

Explicitly exclude tables by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the _Exclude_ field. OpenMetadata will exclude all tables with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other tables will be included. See the figure above for an example.

**Include (Schema Filter Pattern)**

Use to schema filter patterns to control whether or not to include schemas as part of metadata ingestion and data profiling.

Explicitly include schemas by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the _Include_ field. OpenMetadata will include all schemas with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other schemas will be excluded.

**Exclude (Schema Filter Pattern)**

Explicitly exclude schemas by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the _Exclude_ field. OpenMetadata will exclude all schemas with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other schemas will be included.

**Include views (toggle)**

Set the _Include views_ toggle to the on position to control whether or not to include views as part of metadata ingestion and data profiling.

Explicitly include views by adding the following key-value pair in the `source.config` field of your configuration file.

**Enable data profiler (toggle)**

The data profiler ingests usage information for tables. This enables you to assess the frequency of use, reliability, and other details.

When enabled, the data profiler will run as part of metadata ingestion. Running the data profiler increases the amount of time it takes for metadata ingestion but provides the benefits mentioned above.

Set the _Enable data profiler_ toggle to the on position to enable the data profiler.

**Ingest sample data (toggle)**

Set the _Ingest sample data_ toggle to the on position to control whether or not to generate sample data to include in table views in the OpenMetadata user interface.

</details>

### 7. Schedule the Ingestion and Deploy

Scheduling can be set up at an hourly, daily, or weekly cadence. The timezone is in UTC. Select a Start Date to schedule for ingestion. It is optional to add an End Date.

Review your configuration settings. If they match what you intended, click _Deploy_ to create the service and schedule metadata ingestion.

If something doesn't look right, click the _Back_ button to return to the appropriate step and change the settings as needed.

<details>

<summary><strong>Scheduling Options</strong></summary>

**Every**

Use the _Every_ drop down menu to select the interval at which you want to ingest metadata. Your options are as follows:

* _Hour_: Ingest metadata once per hour
* _Day_: Ingest metadata once per day
* _Week_: Ingest metadata once per week

**Day**

The _Day_ selector is only active when ingesting metadata once per week. Use the _Day_ selector to set the day of the week on which to ingest metadata.

**Minute**

The _Minute_ dropdown is only active when ingesting metadata once per hour. Use the _Minute_ drop down menu to select the minute of the hour at which to begin ingesting metadata.

**Time**

The _Time_ drop down menus are active when ingesting metadata either once per day or once per week. Use the time drop downs to select the time of day at which to begin ingesting metadata.

**Start date (UTC)**

Use the _Start date_ selector to choose the date at which to begin ingesting metadata according to the defined schedule.

**End date (UTC)**

Use the _End date_ selector to choose the date at which to stop ingesting metadata according to the defined schedule. If no end date is set, metadata ingestion will continue according to the defined schedule indefinitely.

</details>

After configuring the workflow, you can click on _Deploy_ to create the pipeline.

![Schedule the Ingestion Pipeline and Deploy](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

### 8. View the Ingestion Pipeline <a href="#8.-view-the-ingestion-pipeline" id="8.-view-the-ingestion-pipeline"></a>

Once the workflow has been successfully deployed, you can view the Ingestion Pipeline running from the Service Page.

![View the Ingestion Pipeline from the Service Page](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (55) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

### 9. Workflow Deployment Error <a href="#8.-view-the-ingestion-pipeline" id="8.-view-the-ingestion-pipeline"></a>

If there were any errors during the workflow deployment process, the Ingestion Pipeline Entity will still be created, but no workflow will be present in the Ingestion container.

You can then edit the Ingestion Pipeline and _Deploy_ it again.

![Edit and Deploy the Ingestion Pipeline](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32) (2) (1).png>)

From the _Connection_ tab, you can also _Edit_ the Service if needed.
